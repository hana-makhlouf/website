        <br><br>
        <p>I enrolled in the University of Nottingham as a full-time Electronic and Computer Engineering
            student in September 2017. Since then, I has been involved in projects ranging from building
            robotic cars to sensor systems for extreme environments. Outside of my studies, I am extremely
            passionate about encouraging and empowering girls and women to pursue careers in STEM fields.
            This fuelled my motivation to become one of the founding members of the university's first
            Women's Engineering Society.
            <br><br>
            Since joining university, I have enjoyed trying new things and
            exploring new places such as spending a summer studying AI and Wearable Electronics in Hong Kong,
            learning salsa dancing and participating in inter-university competitions (and winning some awards!)
            and winning 2nd place at the 2019 Google BGN Hackathon.</p>


        <p>Here are a few exciting things I have done in the past!</p>
