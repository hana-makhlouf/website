        <h3>Autonomous Robotic Car: First Year Engineering Project</h3>
        <p>The process involved designing and building several circuits, implementing 
        computer vision using a Raspberry Pi and configuring several sensor circuits
        using Arduino. <br> This was a group project with 4 coursemates. Our group won
        second place in the poster competition as well as earning a place in the top 5 for accuracy 
        of the robotic car. <br> This was assessed through a race where all built cars had to overcome 
        obstacles, measure the angle of an incline, stop at red traffic lights and shoot a ball into a goal.
